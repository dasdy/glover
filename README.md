# glover

- Record keypresses from Glove80 (or potentially other ZMK-based keyboards)
- Multiple ways to collect the data:
  - Through explicit pointing to usb devices
  - Parse logs from standard input
  - Search and auto-connect to devices - either as a one-time operation, or as a monitor that can re-connect to devices
- Make a heatmap for my lovely Glove80, viewable through a web interface
- Show which key combinations are used the most
- Show key "neighbors" - keys that are pressed in consequence: before or after the specific key, but not necessarily in one combination
- Merge keypress data from multiple computers

## Keyboard setup

In order for keyboard to report events, you need to put special value in config.
Refer to [ZMK docs](https://zmk.dev/docs/development/usb-logging#enabling-logging-on-older-boards)
for this. For example, in my `glove80.conf`, I have this line:

```conf
CONFIG_ZMK_USB_LOGGING=y
```

I am not aware of any way to enable similar feature of key logging without
a need for usb connection, so currently there's no other option other than
putting the line above to your keyboards' config and using it via usb.

## Run

### Track

```bash
make build
./tmp/glover track -f /dev/tty.usbmodem12301 -f /dev/tty.usbmodem12401 -o keypresses.sqlite -v
```

This will also open a web interface, default location is localhost:3000

Interface looks roughly like this:

Alternatively, you can try using auto-detection of the keybard devices:

```bash
./tmp/glover track -m monitor  -o keypresses.sqlite -v
```

This will automatically monitor your `/dev/` folder and connect new devices as they appear.

### Show

In case if you don't need active key tracking, you can only run the web interface

```bash
./tmp/glover show -s keypresses.sqlite -p 8000
```

## Develop

### Prerequisites

You need following things:

1. `go` for the compiler
2. `npm` for `tailwind` and `prettier`
3. `golangci-lint` if you want to run full CI suite locally.

All 3 of those usually should be installed via your favourite package manager:

```bash
brew install npm go golangci-lint

npm install
```

### Live-reload

For development, it's easy to use [air](https://github.com/air-verse/air). Make sure to install `npm` to make changes
to the css/js related things.

```bash
make run-dev
```

It's possible to just run `air`. In this case, template generation and tailwind daemon won't run, so only changes to the `.go` files will take effect (which is sometimes the only needed thing).

### Tests

```bash

# To run specific tests, but all by default
go test ./...

# To run benchmarks
go test -bench -benchtime=10s ./...
# OR, to run only tests
make test
```

To get coverage report, you can use

```bash
make cover
```
